# EC
open-source EC
(Fork off mlh2865)


bhop only works in usermode and efi at the moment and to use bhop just rebind your jump key in settings (you have to do it while your alive and on the ground)
To build you must first download Visual Studio 2022 c++. Then you must download windows wdk kit and sdk kit. Make sure to download the vm files and put them into the vm folder in the library/vm folder.Then if you want efi you must run the .bat file. If you want user mode you need to open visual studio code and build it. Make sure to add the sdl3.dll file to where the um.exe file is. Then launch cs2 and open the console and type in cl_crosshairalpha 200. 
 
Use case 200.
RCS kind off broken.
